6. Phase 2: UI Redesign (Mobile-First & Responsive)
   This phase focuses on a complete UI/UX overhaul to achieve a clean, elegant, and sophisticated aesthetic, prioritizing the mobile experience and ensuring full responsiveness across all screen sizes.

6.1. Redesign Goals:
Mobile-First Approach: Design and implement layouts and interactions optimized for small screens first, then progressively enhance for larger devices (tablets, desktops).

Aesthetic Consistency: Maintain the elegant and sophisticated feel established by the favicon, using a harmonious color palette, clear typography, ample whitespace, subtle depth (shadows/gradients), and minimalist iconography.

Intuitive Interaction: Ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable/clickable, with clear visual feedback. Streamline user flows for core tasks.

Clarity & Hierarchy: Information should be presented clearly, with a strong visual hierarchy that guides the user's eye and reduces cognitive load, especially on mobile.

6.2. Key Responsive Layout Concepts:
Mobile:

Primary content area with a persistent bottom navigation bar.

Secondary tasks (e.g., "My Availability," "People & Groups," "Proposed Times") will utilize full-screen modals or dedicated views accessed via the bottom navigation.

Overlap Grid: Days stack vertically (scrollable), time slots scroll horizontally within a day.

Desktop/Tablet:

The bottom navigation bar will be replaced by a persistent or collapsible left sidebar, housing the "My Availability," "People & Groups," and "Proposed Times" sections.

The main content area will expand to prominently display the "Overlap Grid," allowing more data (days/hours) to be visible simultaneously.

Full-screen modals from mobile will transition to smaller, elegant side-panels or popovers on larger screens, allowing context to remain visible.

6.3. Styling Principles:
Color Palette: Soft neutrals for backgrounds (e.g., #F8F8F8, #FFFFFF, #F0F2F5), professional accents for highlights and active states (e.g., #4DB6AC, #80CBC4, #263238, #A7FFEB).

Typography: A single, clean sans-serif font family (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Open Sans). Varied weights and sizes for clear hierarchy.

Spacing: Generous use of padding and margins (whitespace) to prevent clutter and create a clean, airy feel.

Rounded Corners: Consistent application of subtle border-radius (e.g., 4px to 8px) on all interactive elements, cards, and containers.

Transitions & Animations: Subtle CSS transitions for hover states, active elements, and view changes to enhance user experience (e.g., 0.2s ease-in-out).
